Query all open redlines from `.redlines.json` in the project root and present a summary.

## Process

1. Read `.redlines.json` from the project root using the Read tool
2. Parse the JSON array
3. Filter to entries where `status === 'open'`
4. Sort by `created_at` ascending

For each open redline, show:
1. Number (row position in the open list, for use with `/redline:defer`)
2. Page URL
3. Element selector
4. Feedback text
5. When it was left

End with a count: "X open redlines"

If the file doesn't exist or is empty, report "0 open redlines".
