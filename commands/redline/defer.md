# Redline Defer

Storage: `redline/feedback.json` in the project root.

## If argument is "list"

Show all deferred redlines with their UUIDs (so user can reference them directly in `/redline:fix`):

1. Read `redline/feedback.json`
2. Filter to entries where `status === 'deferred'`
3. Sort by `created_at` ascending
4. Display each with a row number, UUID, page_url, element_selector, feedback, and created_at

Display each with its UUID so the user can do `/redline:fix <uuid>` directly without undeferring first.

## If argument is a number

Defer an open redline by its position in the open list:

1. Read `redline/feedback.json`
2. Filter to entries where `status === 'open'`, sort by `created_at` ascending
3. Find the entry at position N (1-based)
4. Update its `status` to `'deferred'`
5. Write the updated array back to `redline/feedback.json`
6. Confirm which redline was deferred

## If argument is "undo" followed by a number

Reopen a deferred redline by its position in the deferred list:

1. Read `redline/feedback.json`
2. Filter to entries where `status === 'deferred'`, sort by `created_at` ascending
3. Find the entry at position N (1-based)
4. Update its `status` to `'open'`
5. Write the updated array back to `redline/feedback.json`
6. Confirm which redline was reopened
