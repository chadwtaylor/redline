Clear all redlines regardless of status.

## Process

1. Read `redline/feedback.json` to count existing entries
2. Write an empty array `[]` to `redline/feedback.json`
3. Report the count cleared (e.g., "Cleared 5 redlines")

If the file doesn't exist or is already empty, report "No redlines to clear".
